## Description
My personal portfolio has been created to resemble the mock up example, yet still have unique styling elements of its own. The html file contains a main header with a title and navigation bar, and a main section containing seven sections displaying content. The portfolio has three main sections: the 'About Me,' applications, and contact information. There is also a small sidebar to identify the application section of the page, and a footer has been added with a salutation.
